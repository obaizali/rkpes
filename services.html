                                <p>Our organization has a single-minded focus, to guide students to the best possible Institutions, thus enabling them to build their future. Using our expertise and vast experience we can identify the most suitable university for each student. We are the stepping-stones to their future and remember that their success is directly linked to our success,no one waits till they have passed out of high school. For those who are really interested in making the mark, the preparations start from the middle school itself and it might be a little overwhelming for some to choose what is best for them. While some want to follow their grades, there are those who want to follow their hearts and as education concierge, RKPES believes that there should be no compromise at any end. Hence, we conduct extensive career counselling sessions where students who aspire to make it big might find the rights answers to their queries. We help the students understand their true potentials and get them access to the universities and colleges abroad where their skills might be further nurtured and honed. Most of the time, students who are interested in getting a management degree or a medical degree from a foreign university do so because of the high career prospects and in most cases, they go on to become successful in their respective fields, establishing themselves in a very short span of time. Our counsellors are not just interested in the grades, but are also mindful about accommodating the studentâ€™s own likes and desires, and finding them an institution where they would grow as an individual as well as a professional. RKPES has already of thousands of students realise their potential and they are more confident now than they were ever before, taking bold stripes in their career.</p>

                                <p>It is important to carefully understand why you choose to study in a particular institution .There are several important factors that need to be understood before you take this big step. RKPES believes in giving the real picture to students & parents.RKPES represents institutions across country. To choose the right university, it is essential to look beyond the general information that is widely available and delve deeper into the courses offered and the future after its completion.RKPES has been helping students in selecting the right university for quite some time now and those who have enrolled with our help have found the best of places. We make the students acquainted with everything so that they can make an informed decision about where they want to study, and that includes information not only about the education, but also about the general ambience, hostel facilities, admission procedures and interviews, tuition fees, library and other facilities as well, those that make a student feel really at home. Once all these criteria matches, there is no stopping a bright young student from going out and achieving their dreams and RKPES has made that possible with quite a few of them.All programs are covered from UG to PG.</p>

                                <p>When a student first starts applying to foreign colleges and universities, one of the first hurdles to be faced by them is the admission procedures. Those applying from India might find this process a bit daunting because marks and grades, though comprising much of the procedure, do not incorporate all of it. There are rounds of interviews to be tackled, and the nature of questions might differ from country to country or college to college. There might be separate admission examinations in some cases and in addition to clearing all the college examinations, one need to clear those as well to secure a seat in the highly competitive environment.</p>
